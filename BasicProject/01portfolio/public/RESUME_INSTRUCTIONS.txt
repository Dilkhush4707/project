RESUME INSTRUCTIONS

To make the floating resume download button work properly:

1. Create your resume as a PDF file
2. Name it "resume.pdf"
3. Place it in this public folder (portfolio/public/)

The button is configured to download this file when clicked. If you prefer a different filename, you can modify the FloatingButton.tsx component and update the href and download attributes.

Example:
```jsx
<motion.a
  href="/your-custom-filename.pdf" 
  download="Dilkhush_Jangid_Resume.pdf"
  // ... other props
>
```
